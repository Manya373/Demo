    <h1>How to join Jugaad</h1>
    <p>
      Jugaad is an India-based platform that blends modern tech with Aadhaar-powered verification
       to help people of all ages find fair and easy employment — because everyone deserves a chance to shine 
    </p>
    <p>
     The vision is simple: every skilled person — from students to homemakers to retired individuals — should have the chance to support 
     their community and earn with respect, while Hirers receive honest, dependable help close to home
    </p>

    <h2>Step 1 – Basic account</h2>
    <p>
      First, create your Jugaad account using your name, mobile number, email and age details. This
      helps place you in the correct age group and keeps the community transparent.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 2 – Identity & safety</h2>
    <p>
      Jugaad is designed to work with Indian identity systems like Aadhaar verification in the future,
      so Helpers and Hirers can trust that profiles are real people, not bots or fake accounts. [web:114][web:126]
    </p>
    <p>
      Basic checks and clear information about age, city and role help families feel safer when inviting
      someone to help at home or at a small event.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 3 – Choose how you join</h2>

    <h3>Join as a Helper</h3>
    <p>You can sign up as a Helper if you want to offer your skills and time.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fill your profile with your age group, city and the type of work you are comfortable doing.</li>
      <li>Choose tags like teaching, child care, events, cooking or tech support to show your strengths.</li>
      <li>Start accepting suitable work from nearby Hirers when you have time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Join as a Hirer</h3>
    <p>You can sign up as a Hirer if you mainly want to get work done.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Describe the task clearly – what help you need, when, for how long and in which area.</li>
      <li>Look for Helpers whose profiles and age groups match your requirement and comfort level.</li>
      <li>Coordinate, complete the work and give clear feedback so the community becomes stronger.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 4 – Grow with your community</h2>
    <p>
     As Jugaad grows in your neighbourhood, 
     Helpers unlock more earning and learning opportunities,
      and Hirers get reliable local help whenever they need it
    </p>
